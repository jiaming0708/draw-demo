# DrawDemo

Origin I used jQuery and all logic in one component, but it's too complex.
Try to rewrite, make it simple and one function in one component.

# Goal

* data from API
* draw a line and arrow to each two point
* data flow direction order by date
* point is small if there have over one point in one cell

# Result
![output](https://github.com/jiaming0708/draw-demo/blob/master/output.png)

# Development

Follow angular-cli standard.

## server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
